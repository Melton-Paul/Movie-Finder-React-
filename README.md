# Movie List Creator

    Description:
    This app was built using React and is for those of us who have a passion for watching movies, but can not always remember what movie 
    we thought about watching before. 
    This app solves that issue, input your movie title and  this app will search through the OMDb API for that title and pull back all 
    relevant movies. If you find the movie you are looking for, then click the "add to watchlist" button, which will push the movie ID 
    to your local storage, saving it for you and rendering it out to your "watchlist" page until you decide to remove it.
